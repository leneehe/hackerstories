# Hacker Stories
A remake of newsfeed from HackerNews

Deployed on Heroku: https://hacker-stories.herokuapp.com/

Instructions:
 
Please clone the newsfeed on HackerNews (https://news.ycombinator.com/).
 
Please note the following:
 
1) Please use the HackerNews API to load articles - https://github.com/HackerNews/API
2) No need to re-create the up-voting and/or commenting feature - instead, link to the real hacker news comment page
3) Do not use jQuery - please use raw vanilla JS. When the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, please load another 30 posts using AJAX (and append them to the bottom of the page)
4) Make the page mobile responsive, just like HackerNews.
5) No need to re-create search (at the bottom).
6) Do not use a table layout - we will be judging you based on your ability to re-create a clean responsive UI. That said, feel free to use Bootstrap and/or Foundation.
7) Please make the front-end look identical (or as close as possible) to HackerNews (screenshot attached).
8) Deploy live version on Heroku
